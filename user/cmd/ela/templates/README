This package contains event-logging templates for the following drivers:

1. e100 (Ethernet)
2. emulex (lpfc fiber channel driver)
3. ipr (SCSI)
4. bcm5700 (Broadcom ethernet)
5. e1000 (Ethernet)
6. pcnet32 (Ethernet)
7. olympic (Token-ring)

Prerequisites
-------------
To build the templates, you need:
- evlog-1.6.1

To use the installed templates, you need to do the following:
- The kernel should be patched with the following kernel patches:
        - evlog-2.6.x.patch (basic evlog capabilities)
        - dev_evlog-2.6.x.patch (makes the dev_printk macro log to evlog
           as well as printk)
- In the *config menu system, under General Setup, the options
   "Event logging support" and "Forward printk messages to event log"
   should be enabled.

Installation
------------

1. Change directory to /usr/share/doc/packages/evlog/templates and edit the
   evlog_env file to your environment. 
   Change to the driver directory and then run 'make'.  make creates binary
   templates (with the *.to extension) and (for some drivers) puts them
   in a subdirectory.  It also creates one or more 'ela rules' files
   (with .rules extension).  For example:
	
	cd /usr/share/doc/packages/evlog/templates
	vi evlog_env
	cd ipr
	make

   Note: if 'make' may fail if you don't have the facility registered, then
         use 'evlfacility -a <facility name>' to register a facility.

2. As root,

	make install


3. The ela rules files are also created by make.  (In this example, the
   ipr_main.rules and ipr_sub.rules are created.)  One can load the ela
   rules using the ela_add utility (as root).

	/sbin/ela_add -f ipr_main.rules
	/sbin/ela_add -f ipr_sub.rules

4. Note that the ela rules need to be reloaded after each system reboot. One\      can reload the ela rules automatically with a startup script, as follows. 
   
	a) Edit the /usr/share/evlog/load_ela_rules.sh to match your 
	   environment.
	
	b) Load this /usr/share/evlog/load_ela_rules.sh with 
	   /etc/rc.d/rc.local by adding /usr/share/evlog/load_ela_rules.sh at
	   the end of the file.
