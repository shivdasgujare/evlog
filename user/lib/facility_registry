# Facility registry: Numeric codes and names for event-logging facilities.
#
# Field 1 is the decimal, hex, or octal facility code.
#
# Field 2 is the facility's name.  Its length must not exceed 127
# (POSIX_LOG_MEMSTR_MAXLEN-1) characters.  The name must not contain any
# double quotes (").  If the name contains any tabs or spaces, the entire
# name must be enclosed in double quotes.
#
# The remaining fields are optional.  If included, they must appear in the
# following order:
# - The word "private", which specifies that events logged by that facility
# will be logged to the read-protected log /var/evlog/privatelog.
# - The word "kernel", which specifies that only the kernel is permitted
# to log events with that facility code.
# - A filter string, which must be a valid POSIX query expression.  For that
# facility, only events that match that filter will be logged.
#
# For example:
#	0x6871010d "Bob's FS" kernel 'severity > info'
# specifies that the facility whose name is "Bob's FS" has a facility code
# of 0x6871010d.  Any event logged by this facility that doesn't come from
# the kernel, or has a severity of INFO or less, will be discarded.
#
# Before removing or renaming any entries, consult POSIX 1003.25 for a list
# of standard facilities.
#
# It is best to use the evlfacility command to add, modify, or remove entries
# in this registry.
